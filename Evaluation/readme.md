## Abstract

What we did in this exam was a machine learnig algorithm, to clean the dataset that was given to us we use multilayer perceptron.

We were granted a dataset called iris.csv, which we cleaned we filtered to be able to work with the data and to be able to make the points that came in the pdf that was given to us, as a final conclusion of neural networks, I could realize that each Once you run the algorithm, it takes less time to finish the process, that is, if the first time it lasted 0.86 seconds, the second time you run it, it would take less time than that, and I also realized that its possibility of success never changes, unless you change it. input layers, hidden layers or output layers, remember it must be balanced or it could overflow.
